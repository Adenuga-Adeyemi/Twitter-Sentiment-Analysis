##ðŸŽ¯ Task 4 of 5: Sentiment Analysis Prodigy InfoTechðŸŽ¯
I had the opportunity to work on the project aimed at visualizing sentiment patterns on brands and evaluating public attitudes towards specific brands.
ðŸ“Š hashtag#Objective:
1. To analyze sentiment distribution across different brands are perceived.
2. To identify trends, compare sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral, irrelevant), and provide recommendations for improving public perception.
ðŸ“ˆ hashtag#Analysis:
Data Source: Kaggle.com
- Using PowerQuery, I cleaned and structured the dataset.
- Through DAX, I created measures for calculating sentiment percentages, trends, and brand-specific sentiment distribution.
- With Power BI, I designed the dashboard, showcasing key insights like:
Sentiment distributions (positive: 27.49%, negative: 30.28%, etc.).
- Top and bottom brands based on sentiment labels.
- Percentage breakdowns and patterns over time.
ðŸ’¡ hashtag#Key hashtag#Findings:
Negative Sentiments lead in total volume, indicating potential dissatisfaction or controversy around certain brands.
Brands like Tom Clancyâ€™s Rain and Verizon performed well in positive sentiments, while Battlefield and Assassin's Creed faced challenges.
Irrelevant Sentiments accounted for 17.49%, suggesting content not directly engaging the target audience.
ðŸ›  hashtag#Recommendations:
1. For Brands with High Negative Sentiment:
Address customer concerns by monitoring feedback and implementing targeted response strategies.
2. Develop proactive PR campaigns to rebuild trust.
3. For Neutral and Irrelevant Sentiments, shift focus towards engaging storytelling to convert passive sentiment into active engagement.
4. Leverage Positive Sentiment, strengthen campaigns around brands/topics with high positive sentiment to amplify goodwill.
